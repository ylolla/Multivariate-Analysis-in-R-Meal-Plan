Note: Each of the above items was written on a card and the respondent was      asked to tell the interviewer the number that best describes how often he or she felt or behaved this way during the past week. Thus respondents who       answered item 2, "I felt depressed," could respond 0 through 3, depending       on whether this particular item applied to them rarely or none of the time      (less than 1 day: 0), some or little of the time (1-2 days: 1),     occasionally or a moderate amount of time (3-4 days: 2), or most or all of      the time (5-7 days: 3).
